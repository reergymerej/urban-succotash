# Elm 19 Ports Example

This is for Elm noobs struggling to find a _simple_ ports example.  This shows
how to send an Int to JS and how to receive one.  Checkout out the
`show-decode-errors` branch for a _barely_ more complex example that
demonstrates how to get started with decode errors.

## install
```
yarn
```

## build
```
yarn build
```

## run
```
yarn start
# open http://localhost:8000
```
